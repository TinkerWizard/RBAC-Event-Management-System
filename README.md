# RBAC Event Management System

## Overview

The **Event Management System (EMS)** is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** application designed to streamline event management with a secure and efficient approach. With predefined roles such as `ADMIN`, `ORGANIZER`, and `VIEWER`, alongside granular permissions like `Manage Users`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Events`, and `Register Events`, the system ensures users have appropriate access based on their responsibilities.

## Features

### Manage Roles
- **Create/Add Roles**: Only `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_roles` permission can create roles and assign permissions.
- **Read/View Roles**: Only accessible to `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_roles` permission.
- **Update Roles**: Only `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_roles` permission can modify role names or permissions.
- **Delete Roles**: Only `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_roles` permission can delete roles.

### Manage Users
- **Create/Add Users**: Only `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_users` permission can add users and set their account status (`ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`).
- **Read/View Users**: Only accessible to `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_users` permission.
- **Update Users**: Modify details like email, role, status, or additional permissions (`ADMIN` or users with `manage_users`).
- **Delete Users**: Only `ADMIN` or users with the `manage_users` permission can delete users.

### Manage Events
- **Create/Add Events**: `ORGANIZER` or users with `manage_events` permission can create events.
- **Read/View Events**:  
  - `ORGANIZER` (creator) or users with `manage_events`/`register_events` permissions can view events.  
  - **Special Case**: Log in as `sarves` (predefined `ORGANIZER`) to view multiple events. If a new `ORGANIZER` logs in, no events will be listed until they create one.
- **Update/Delete Events**:  
  Only `ORGANIZER` (creator) or users with `manage_events` permission can update or delete events.

### Export Events
- **Export to Excel**: Accessible to `ORGANIZER` or users with `manage_events` and `export_events` permissions.
- **Export to PDF**: **Planned for future implementation.**

### Register Events
- **View and Register**:  
  `VIEWER` or users with the `register_events` permission can view and register for events.
