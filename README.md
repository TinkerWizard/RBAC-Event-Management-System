# RBAC Event Management System

## Overview

The **Event Management System (EMS)** is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** application designed for secure and efficient event management. With predefined roles such as `ADMIN`, `ORGANIZER`, and `VIEWER`, and granular permissions like `Manage Users`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Events`, and `Register/Unregister Events`, the system ensures that users have appropriate access levels based on their roles and responsibilities.

### Manage Events
- **Create/Add Events**:  
  Only `ORGANIZER` and users with the `manage_events` permission can create events.
- **Read/View Events**:

  - **Special Case**:  
    - **Sarves** is a predefined `ORGANIZER` who has added multiple events.  
    - **Nalan** is another predefined `ORGANIZER` who cannot view events created by `Sarves` unless they have the `register_events` permission.
- **Update Events**:  
  Only `ORGANIZER` (the creator) or users with the `manage_events` permission can update events.
- **Delete Events**:  
  Only `ORGANIZER` (the creator) or users with the `manage_events` permission can delete events.

### Export Events
- **Export to Excel**:  
  Only `ORGANIZER` or users with both the `manage_events` and `export_events` permissions can export events to an Excel file.
- **Export to PDF**:  
  **Planned for future implementation.**

### Register/Unregister Events
- **View and Register Events**:  
  `VIEWER` or users with the `register_events` and `unregister_events` permissions can view the list of events and register/unregister for events.
